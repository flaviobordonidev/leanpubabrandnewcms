# acknowledgments

Here the author thanks people helpful in some way relative to the book: perhaps a writing instructor, the editor at the publishing house, the author’s agent, a supportive spouse, etc.  The Acknowledgements might follow the Dedication, the Table of Contents or even appear in the Back Matter, depending on the publisher’s preference.

Sometimes the author says thanks by cleverly using the book’s theme or images.  For instance, in The New Year’s Quilt, author Jennifer Chiaverini offers symbolic bottles of champagne to publishing professionals, party hats and noisemakers to her nanny, a chorus of “Auld Lang Syne” to family and friends, and a “sky full of fireworks for my husband, Marty, and my sons, Nicholas and Michael, for making every New Year the happiest yet.”
