# <a name="top"></a> Cap ajax.1 - Overview

Vediamo la gestiona asincrona di Javascript ed altro.
Questa sezione tratta:

- ajax
- turbo (che ha sostituito turbo_link)
- hotwire
- stimulus


> ajax: AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. AJAX is a new technique for creating better, faster, and more interactive web applications.

> Turbo: Turbo uses complementary techniques to dramatically reduce the amount of custom JavaScript that most web applications will need to write: Turbo Drive accelerates links and form submissions by negating the need for full page reloads.

> hotwire: Hotwire is an alternative approach to building modern web applications without using much JavaScript by sending HTML instead of JSON over the wire.

>Hotwire’s combination of Turbo and Stimulus deliver all the tools needed to produce fantastic user experiences that leave little to nothing on the table in contrast to single-page applications – at a fraction of the complexity. It’s the default choice for new Rails apps, replacing the far more limited options of Turbolinks and Rails UJS.
