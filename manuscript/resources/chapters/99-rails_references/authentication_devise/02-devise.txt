    In this tutorial, we will install devise and create the user and post model. We will also set up emails in production with the Heroku Sendgrid addon.

    We are likely going to need at least two to three posts just to customize devise. The first thing I want to do is add the FriendlyId gem, so we can create nice looking user and post urls, such as: https://yourdomain/users/your-name.
