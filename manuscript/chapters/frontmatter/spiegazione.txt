# acknowledgments / riconoscimenti

Here the author thanks people helpful in some way relative to the book: perhaps a writing instructor, the editor at the publishing house, the author’s agent, a supportive spouse, etc.  The Acknowledgements might follow the Dedication, the Table of Contents or even appear in the Back Matter, depending on the publisher’s preference.

Sometimes the author says thanks by cleverly using the book’s theme or images.  For instance, in The New Year’s Quilt, author Jennifer Chiaverini offers symbolic bottles of champagne to publishing professionals, party hats and noisemakers to her nanny, a chorus of “Auld Lang Syne” to family and friends, and a “sky full of fireworks for my husband, Marty, and my sons, Nicholas and Michael, for making every New Year the happiest yet.”

Grazie a tutti per la pazienza, l'aiuto e l'ispirazione.

# preface / prefazione

Written by the book’s author, the Preface contains important information relating to the book topic, but outside of the book’s contents.

For example, in The Gift, the Preface is where Richard Paul Evans reveals that he has Tourette’s syndrome.

# introduction / introduzione

The author gives the reader more details about the book in this optional section. In trade nonfiction books, the Introduction may be an informal “Dear Reader” letter getting the reader excited about the information presented, inviting the reader inside the book and giving an overview of the book’s contents.
The pagination starts here.
