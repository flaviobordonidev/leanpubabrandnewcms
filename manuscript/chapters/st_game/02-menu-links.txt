When we need to have a hyper link to an id in the same page

given that your html id is #my_id

<%= link_to('Click here to do to my_id', :anchor => 'my_id') %>
<div id="my_id"></div>

Anchors with link_to
You might need to point to a specific section (anchor) in the page which you can identify by it’s dom ID. So let’s say on the target page we have a section that has the id="interesting-section". In order to point our link to that section, we’ll need to add the anchor to the generated link.

<%= link_to "Section", root_path(:anchor => "interesting-section") %>
# => <a href="/#interesting-section">Section</a>
