## Domanda su Stackoverflow

I have a database that has stored information of some users. I know for example: User.find(1) will return the user with id:1

What should I call to find a user by email? I searched a lot but could not find anything.

I also tried User.find(:email => "xyz@abc.com") but it doesn't work.


Use

~~~~~~~~
User.find_by_email("abc@xyz.com")
~~~~~~~~

Must check these two post from railscast (For rails3)
http://railscasts.com/episodes/202-active-record-queries-in-rails-3
http://railscasts.com/episodes/215-advanced-queries-in-rails-3

Just to add something, there's also a rails guide on queries. And here is shown that the find_by_* is dynamically available. – Rik Poggi Oct 1 '12 at 7:06

Oppure si può usare

~~~~~~~~
User.where(email: "abc@xyz.com").first
~~~~~~~~
