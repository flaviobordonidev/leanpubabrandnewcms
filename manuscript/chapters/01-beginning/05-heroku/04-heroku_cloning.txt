## Clonare il sorgente usando Git

To clone the source of an existing application from Heroku using Git, use the heroku git:clone command:

{title="terminal", lang=bash, line-numbers=off}
~~~~~~~~
$ heroku git:clone -a myapp
~~~~~~~~

Replace myapp with the name of your app.
This will create a new directory named after your app with its source and complete repository history, as well as adding a heroku git remote to facilitate further updates.
Heroku provides the git service primarily for deployment, and the ability to clone from it is offered as a convenience. We strongly recommend you store your code in another git repository such as GitHub and treat that as canonical.

{title="terminal", lang=bash, line-numbers=off}
~~~~~~~~
$ heroku apps:transfer -a <app-to-transfer> <collaborator-to-transfer-it-to@example.com>
