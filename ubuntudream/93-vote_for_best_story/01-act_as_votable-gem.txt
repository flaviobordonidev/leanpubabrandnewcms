Acts As Votable is a Ruby Gem specifically written for Rails/ActiveRecord models. The main goals of this gem are:

Allow any model to be voted on, like/dislike, upvote/downvote, etc.
Allow any model to be voted under arbitrary scopes.
Allow any model to vote. In other words, votes do not have to come from a user, they can come from any model (such as a Group or Team).
Provide an easy to write/read syntax.
